In this two-player dice game, Player 1 starts by rolling a six-sided dice, adding the number to their score. Rolling a 1 resets the score. Players can roll or hold to accumulate points. Holding adds the score to the total and switches turns. The game goes on until someone reaches 100 points to win.
