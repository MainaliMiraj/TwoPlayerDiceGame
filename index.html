Player 1 Starts: The game begins with Player 1 rolling a standard six-sided dice.

Scoring: The number rolled on the dice is added to the player's current score. If a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends, and their current score is reset to 0. If any other number is rolled, it's added to the current score, and the player has the option to roll again (choose to "Roll") or stop their turn and "Hold" their current score.

Roll or Hold: If a player decides to "Roll" again, they continue rolling the dice, accumulating points with each non-1 roll. They can roll as many times as they want until they either choose to "Hold" or roll a 1.

Holding: When a player decides to "Hold," their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.

Switching Turns: The game continues with players taking turns, rolling the dice, and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn, and it becomes the other player's turn.

Winning: The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points wins the game.
